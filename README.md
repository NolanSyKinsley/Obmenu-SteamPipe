# Obmenu-SteamPopulator
This script when added to the openboc menu, or with obmenu-generator, will auto populate a pipe menu with all of your steam games for easy launching. Includes icon support, but steam sucks at getting icons on linux, check out my other script that will populate the icons for your downloaded games when ran. https://github.com/NolanSyKinsley/SteamIconGetter
